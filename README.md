# My Recipes

This website was created for my 3rd Milestone Project in the Full Stack Software Developer Course provided by [The Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). The goal of this website is to let the User search for different recipes and also share their own recipes. The site will also have an additional area where cooking tools will be advertised that will help them with their recipes.
