# My Recipes

This website was created for my 3rd Milestone Project in the Full Stack Software Developer Course provided by [The Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). The goal of this website is to let the User search for different recipes and also share their own recipes. The site will also have an additional area where cooking tools will be advertised that will help them with their recipes.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

1. As a first time visitor I want to easily navigate throughout the site to find the desired recipe.
2. As a first time visitor I want to be able to locate the social media links to see their followings which will help me determine how trusted and known the site is.
3. As a first time visitor I want to be able to see the final presentation of the recipe so that I know what I am cooking.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

1. As a returning visitor I want to be able to rate the recipe that I had previously picked.
2. As a returning visitor I want to be able to search for a wider range of dishes and also recommended dishes from other users.
3. As a returning visitor I want to be able to get kitchen utensils I don't already own.

#### Frequent User Goals

1. As a frequent user I want to be able to login and keep track of recipes I have used or picked as a favourite.
2. As a frequent user I want to be able to Edit recipes if I have any ideas to improve and this becomes a copy available under the original recipe.
3. As a frequent user I want to be able to order the ingredients for a recipe from a shop.
